# rust-poker

A simple game to demonstrate rust RNG using the poker card game

This project is meant to complement the "Yet Another Rust Tutorial" (YART) series on Youtube.

## Project Objective

The project objective is to create a fully functional command-line game of Poker featuring multiple variants of the card game including Texas Hold 'em, Heads Up, and 7 Card Stud

- Complete Implementation of the game loop
- Functional leaderboard
- Multiplayer Support (Client and Server components)
- Rudimentary AI Engine

The aim here isn't to make an immersive Poker experience, rather, it is to fully understand how rust as a language works along with its quirks and how to deal with them to a certain extent. The features will be implemented progressively as the turorials cover each major topic present in the Rust Book.
